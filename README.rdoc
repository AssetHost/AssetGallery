= AssetGallery

Easy galleries of photos and more built on top of AssetHost.  You can find 
an example implementation on my website at http://ericrichardson.com/gallery/

The client code is a Coffeescript app using Backbone.js.

AssetHost can be found at http://github.com/SCPR/AssetHost

== Requirements

* AssetHost installation, configured in your app via AssetHost[:server] and AssetHost[:token]
* Authentication system that defines @current_user and @current_user.is_admin?
* Layout that looks to @PAGE_TITLE for title info

== Usage

1) Add the plugin to your Gemfile:

    gem 'asset_gallery', :git => 'git://github.com/ewr/AssetGallery.git'

Run `bundle install`

2) Mount AssetGallery's routes.  In config/routes.rb:

    mount AssetGallery::Engine => '/gallery', :as => :gallery

3) Install and run migrations

    rake asset_gallery:install:migrations
    rake db:migrate
